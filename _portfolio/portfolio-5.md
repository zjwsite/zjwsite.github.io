In my sophomore year Signal and Systems class, the instructor left an assignment to separate low frequency signals from high frequency signals. It was easy to call spectrogram() to accomplish. But I was curious, what if the spectrum is overlapped? Or, if the sound is complex (singing, talking), isn't there a way to do it? So I found out that there is, an algorithm in a classical framework - fastICA.
