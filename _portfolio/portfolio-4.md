When I started my internship at IPIU lab, I first learned about the manual feature extraction that would be used in modulation classification. For example, high-order Cumulant, unwrapped phase, etc. Some statistics, matlab, numpy, scipy are already available function to call, such as kurtosis. But some are not yet available and need to be calculated manually. So I wrote a toolbox to calculate them.
