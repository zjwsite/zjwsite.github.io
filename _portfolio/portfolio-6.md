As my research progressed, I learned various techniques for time-frequency analysis, somewhat like "rotation of the time-frequency plane". So I searched and discovered fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) theory. Unfortunately no FRFT code support batch computation using GPU at that time, so I implemented FRFT using Pytorch. And maybe one day I will package it into a package.
